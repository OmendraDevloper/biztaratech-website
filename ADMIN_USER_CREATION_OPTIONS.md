# Admin User Creation Options for Biztara Tech Website

This document outlines different approaches to create an admin user for the Biztara Tech website, with the most reliable method listed first.

## Option 1: MongoDB Atlas Shell (Recommended)

This method bypasses any SSL/TLS issues you might encounter connecting locally.

1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Go to your cluster (Cluster0) and click "Browse Collections"
3. Click the "Mongosh" button to open the MongoDB shell
4. Copy and paste the commands from `create-admin-mongodb-shell.js` directly into the shell
5. Verify the user was created with the provided verification command

## Option 2: MongoDB Compass

If you prefer a GUI tool:

1. Download [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
2. Connect to your MongoDB Atlas cluster using the connection string
3. Navigate to the "Biztara" database and "users" collection
4. Click "Add Data" â†’ "Insert Document"
5. Paste the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Omendra Dwivedi",
  "email": "omendrad@gmail.com",
  "username": "omendra",
  "password": "$2b$10$ZbF6Ypz73Vrm7zF96brYaObtMFcP1qIMKTaJbA0f7a7FtSPjZt9d6",
  "role": "admin",
  "mobile": "8197317345",
  "createdAt": {"$date": "2024-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
}
```

## Option 3: Node.js Scripts (If You Need to Generate New Password Hashes)

If you need to create users with different passwords:

1. Use the provided `generate-hash.js` script to generate bcrypt hashes:
   ```
   node generate-hash.js YourPassword
   ```
2. Replace the password hash in either Option 1 or Option 2

## Option 4: Vercel CLI Deployment Hook

As a last resort, you could create a temporary API endpoint in your application that creates the admin user, deploy it, access it once, then remove it.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues logging in after user creation:

1. Verify the database name matches the one in your Vercel environment variables
2. Check that the password hash was generated with the same bcrypt version
3. Ensure case-sensitivity in usernames and emails matches what you enter on the login form
4. Make sure there are no whitespace characters in the username or email

## Security Notes

- Delete the `create-admin-mongodb-shell.js` file after use
- Always use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts
- Consider implementing two-factor authentication for admin accounts in the future
- Regularly rotate admin passwords and monitor account activity
